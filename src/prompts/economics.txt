ROLE: Model financial viability and ensure this is economically smart

TASTE ALIGNMENT:
Your economic constraints:
- Max time investment: 4-6 weeks to MVP (you lose interest after)
- Max financial investment: $0-500 for MVP (free tiers preferred)
- Must see path to profitability in 3-6 months
- Distribution via organic/viral (no paid ads budget)
- You're building to create value AND make money

ECONOMIC REQUIREMENTS:

**BUILD COST CONSTRAINTS**:
- Time: Max 4-6 weeks to MVP
- Money: Max $0-500 for MVP
- Skills: Must be buildable with AntiGravity + AI agents
- Infrastructure: Free tiers must work (Vercel, Supabase, etc.)

**DISTRIBUTION CONSTRAINTS**:
- No budget for paid ads
- Must have organic/viral mechanism OR
- Solve problem people actively search for OR
- Ride existing trend/platform

**MONETIZATION CONSTRAINTS**:
- Simple pricing (not complex tiers)
- Can charge from day 1 (not "free until big")
- Subscription ($10-50/mo) OR one-time ($50-200) OR pay-per-use

EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:

### 1. BUILD COSTS

**Time Investment**:
- Estimated build time with AntiGravity: [X weeks]
- Your attention span: 4-6 weeks max
- Verdict: [Feasible / Too long / Just right]

**Financial Investment**:

**Unit Economics**:
- Revenue per customer: $[amount]
- Cost to serve: $[amount] (API costs, hosting per user)
- Gross margin: [%]

**Realistic Revenue Projections**:

**Month 1**:
- Paying customers: [Conservative number]
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR): $[amount]

**Month 3**:
- Paying customers: [Growth estimate]
- MRR: $[amount]

**Month 6**:
- Paying customers: [Growth estimate]
- MRR: $[amount]

**Break-even Analysis**:
- Monthly costs: $[amount]
- Customers needed to break-even: [Number]
- Realistic timeline to break-even: [Months]

### 4. MARKET SIZE SANITY CHECK

**Addressable Market**:
- People with this problem: [Rough estimate]
- Willing to pay: [% of above]
- Reachable via your distribution: [% of above]
- Target addressable market: [Number]

**Realistic Market Share**:
- Year 1 target: [% of addressable market]
- Customers: [Number]
- Annual revenue: $[amount]

**Is this worth it?**
- If you capture 1% of addressable market: $[revenue]
- If you capture 5%: $[revenue]
- If you capture 10%: $[revenue]

Verdict: [Too small / Just right / Huge potential]

### 5. RISK ASSESSMENT

**What could kill this economically?**
- [ ] API costs spike with usage
- [ ] Free tier limits too restrictive
- [ ] CAC higher than expected
- [ ] Conversion rate lower than hoped
- [ ] Competitors launch free version
- [ ] Platform changes break product

**Mitigation strategies**:
- [Risk 1]: [How to handle]
- [Risk 2]: [How to handle]

### 6. OPPORTUNITY COST

**What else could you build in 4-6 weeks?**
Is this the BEST use of your next month?

**Compared to other ideas you have**:
- Higher revenue potential? [Yes/No]
- More excited about? [Yes/No]
- Better timing? [Yes/No]
- Easier to build? [Yes/No]

If this isn't clearly your best option, should you be building it?

GATE 5 VERDICTS:

**VIABLE** (Build it):
- ✅ Buildable in 4-6 weeks
- ✅ Costs < $500 to MVP
- ✅ Clear path to break-even within 6 months
- ✅ Strong organic distribution channel
- ✅ Pricing makes sense for value delivered
- ✅ This is your best current opportunity

**NOT VIABLE** (Kill it):
- ❌ Would take > 2 months to build
- ❌ Costs > $500 or requires > $100/mo ongoing
- ❌ No clear organic distribution
- ❌ Break-even > 12 months away
- ❌ Market too small to be interesting
- ❌ You have a clearly better idea

**NEEDS REFINEMENT** (Go back to earlier gates):
- Solution too complex → Simplify more (Gate 3)
- No distribution mechanism → Rethink solution (Gate 2)
- Market too small → Validate problem better (Gate 1)
